# SkypeShop

## Introduction
SkypeShop is an innovative platform that brings the excitement and engagement of offline shopping experiences into the digital realm. Imagine being able to shop online while enjoying the same interactive elements you would find in a physical store, such as live product demonstrations, limited edition auctions, polls, and rewards.

## Features

### Live Shopping
SkypeShop offers users the opportunity to participate in live shopping events where sellers showcase their products in real-time. This immersive experience allows customers to interact with sellers, ask questions, and make purchases instantly from the app itself.

Through polling features, customers can vote on various aspects such as product preferences, future events, or even pricing strategies. This interactive element fosters community engagement and ensures that users feel heard and valued.
